# nasa

My first test app using Vue.js and Axios. Searches the NASA Image API then displays the resulting content.

Designed to be added to a Laravel site with the files in the usual places for Laravel (I'm sorry I have only uploaded the files I have modified specifically for this project).

See "issues" for improvents I intend to make / have made.
