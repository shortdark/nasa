# nasa

My first test app using Vue.js and Axios. Searches the NASA Image API then displays the resulting content. Formatting using asynchronous Bootstrap. The main way I have used PHP/Laravel is to display the individual item pages.

Designed to be added to a Laravel site with the files in the usual places for Laravel (I have only uploaded the files I have modified specifically for this project).

See "issues" for improvents I intend to make / have made if I have time.
